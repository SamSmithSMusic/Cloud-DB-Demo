# Overview

Howdy! I wrote this little demo to help mold out the process for accessing and using a cloud database should function. Hopefully it will help assist both you and I in future, larger projects!

# Cloud Database

I made a basic database using MongoDB as it was the easiest service with the least learning curve for fast functioning databases. I built a relational database to keep track of different songs and concerts with different choirs as well. 

# Development Environment

To interface with the database I used JavaScript as it seemed to make the most sense. I had npm install the MongoDB library which I of course needed for the task at hand. I also ran the JS with Node.js, as the goal was about accessing and manipulating the database. It would be easy though to attribute the knowledge here to manipulating the DOM.

# Useful Websites

- [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
- [W3Schools Documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/mongodb/)

# Future Work

- Add DOM representation
- Write frontend JS to make updating the DB easier
- Learn how to access other databases
